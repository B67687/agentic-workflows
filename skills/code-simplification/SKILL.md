## Overview

Simplify code by reducing complexity while preserving exact behavior. The goal is not fewer lines --- it's code that is easier to read, understand, modify, and debug. Every simplification must pass a simple test: "Would a new team member understand this faster than the original?"

## When to Use

- After a feature is working and tests pass, but the implementation feels heavier than it needs to be
- During code review when readability or complexity issues are flagged
- When you encounter deeply nested logic, long functions, or unclear names
- When refactoring code written under time pressure
- When consolidating related logic scattered across files
- After merging changes that introduced duplication or inconsistency

**When NOT to use:**

- Code is already clean and readable --- don't simplify for the sake of it
- You don't understand what the code does yet --- comprehend before you simplify
- The code is performance-critical and the "simpler" version would be measurably slower
- You're about to rewrite the module entirely --- simplifying throwaway code wastes effort

## The Five Principles

See `references/simplification-principles.md` (L3) for the full five principles with
code examples. Load with:
`bash ./scripts/skill-toolset.sh resource code-simplification references/simplification-principles.md`

Quick summary:

1. **Preserve Behavior Exactly** --- Same outputs, errors, side effects for all inputs
2. **Follow Project Conventions** --- Consistency over preference
3. **Prefer Clarity Over Cleverness** --- Explicit > compact when clarity suffers
4. **Maintain Balance** --- Don't over-simplify; comprehension speed is the goal
5. **Scope to What Changed** --- Simplify modified code, avoid drive-by refactors

## The Simplification Process

### Step 1: Understand Before Touching (Chesterton's Fence)

Before changing or removing anything, understand why it exists. This is Chesterton's Fence: if you see a fence across a road and don't understand why it's there, don't tear it down. First understand the reason, then decide if the reason still applies.

```
BEFORE SIMPLIFYING, ANSWER:
- What is this code's responsibility?
- What calls it? What does it call?
- What are the edge cases and error paths?
- Are there tests that define the expected behavior?
- Why might it have been written this way? (Performance? Platform constraint? Historical reason?)
- Check git blame: what was the original context for this code?
```

If you can't answer these, you're not ready to simplify. Read more context first.

### Step 2: Identify Simplification Opportunities

Scan for these patterns --- each one is a concrete signal, not a vague smell:

**Structural complexity:**

| Pattern | Signal | Simplification |
|---------|--------|----------------|
| Deep nesting (3+ levels) | Hard to follow control flow | Extract conditions into guard clauses or helper functions |
| Long functions (50+ lines) | Multiple responsibilities | Split into focused functions with descriptive names |
| Nested ternaries | Requires mental stack to parse | Replace with if/else chains, switch, or lookup objects |
| Boolean parameter flags | `doThing(true, false, true)` | Replace with options objects or separate functions |
| Repeated conditionals | Same `if` check in multiple places | Extract to a well-named predicate function |

**Naming and readability:**

| Pattern | Signal | Simplification |
|---------|--------|----------------|
| Generic names | `data`, `result`, `temp`, `val`, `item` | Rename to describe the content: `userProfile`, `validationErrors` |
| Abbreviated names | `usr`, `cfg`, `btn`, `evt` | Use full words unless the abbreviation is universal (`id`, `url`, `api`) |
| Misleading names | Function named `get` that also mutates state | Rename to reflect actual behavior |
| Comments explaining "what" | `// increment counter` above `count++` | Delete the comment --- the code is clear enough |
| Comments explaining "why" | `// Retry because the API is flaky under load` | Keep these --- they carry intent the code can't express |

**Redundancy:**

| Pattern | Signal | Simplification |
|---------|--------|----------------|
| Duplicated logic | Same 5+ lines in multiple places | Extract to a shared function |
| Dead code | Unreachable branches, unused variables, commented-out blocks | Remove (after confirming it's truly dead) |
| Unnecessary abstractions | Wrapper that adds no value | Inline the wrapper, call the underlying function directly |
| Over-engineered patterns | Factory-for-a-factory, strategy-with-one-strategy | Replace with the simple direct approach |
| Redundant type assertions | Casting to a type that's already inferred | Remove the assertion |

### Step 3: Apply Changes Incrementally

Make one simplification at a time. Run tests after each change. **Submit refactoring changes separately from feature or bug fix changes.** A PR that refactors and adds a feature is two PRs --- split them.

```
FOR EACH SIMPLIFICATION:
1. Make the change
2. Run the test suite
3. If tests pass -> commit (or continue to next simplification)
4. If tests fail -> revert and reconsider
```

Avoid batching multiple simplifications into a single untested change. If something breaks, you need to know which simplification caused it.

**The Rule of 500:** If a refactoring would touch more than 500 lines, invest in automation (codemods, sed scripts, AST transforms) rather than making the changes by hand. Manual edits at that scale are error-prone and exhausting to review.

### Step 3.5: Structured Edit Pattern (SEARCH/REPLACE)

For surgical edits on known code, use the SEARCH/REPLACE block format.
Each block targets a specific file, locates exact code, and replaces it.
This is more precise than whole-file rewrites for targeted changes.

```
Block Structure:
---
filepath: path/to/file.py
### SEARCH:
<exact code to find, including surrounding context for uniqueness>
### REPLACE:
<new code>
---
```

**Rules:**
1. Include 2-5 lines of surrounding context --- enough to make the SEARCH unique
2. SEARCH must match existing code exactly (whitespace, indentation, comments)
3. One SEARCH/REPLACE block per edit --- multiple blocks for multiple changes
4. After applying, validate syntax (`python3 -c "compile(...)"`, `npx tsc --noEmit`, etc.)

**Derived from:** Aider's SEARCH/REPLACE edit format
([Aider-AI/aider](https://github.com/Aider-AI/aider) --- chat.md edit format specification).
This pattern enables precise, reviewable, and verifiable code edits at scale.

### Step 4: Verify the Result

After all simplifications, step back and evaluate the whole:

```
COMPARE BEFORE AND AFTER:
- Is the simplified version genuinely easier to understand?
- Did you introduce any new patterns inconsistent with the codebase?
- Is the diff clean and reviewable?
- Would a teammate approve this change?
```

If the "simplified" version is harder to understand or review, revert. Not every simplification attempt succeeds.

## Language-Specific Guidance

### TypeScript / JavaScript

```typescript
// SIMPLIFY: Unnecessary async wrapper
// Before
async function getUser(id: string): Promise<User> {
  return await userService.findById(id);
}
// After
function getUser(id: string): Promise<User> {
  return userService.findById(id);
}

// SIMPLIFY: Verbose conditional assignment
// Before
let displayName: string;
if (user.nickname) {
  displayName = user.nickname;
} else {
  displayName = user.fullName;
}
// After
const displayName = user.nickname || user.fullName;

// SIMPLIFY: Manual array building
// Before
const activeUsers: User[] = [];
for (const user of users) {
  if (user.isActive) {
    activeUsers.push(user);
  }
}
// After
const activeUsers = users.filter((user) => user.isActive);

// SIMPLIFY: Redundant boolean return
// Before
function isValid(input: string): boolean {
  if (input.length > 0 && input.length < 100) {
    return true;
  }
  return false;
}
// After
function isValid(input: string): boolean {
  return input.length > 0 && input.length < 100;
}
```

### Python

```python
# SIMPLIFY: Verbose dictionary building
# Before
result = {}
for item in items:
    result[item.id] = item.name
# After
result = {item.id: item.name for item in items}

# SIMPLIFY: Nested conditionals with early return
# Before
def process(data):
    if data is not None:
        if data.is_valid():
            if data.has_permission():
                return do_work(data)
            else:
                raise PermissionError("No permission")
        else:
            raise ValueError("Invalid data")
    else:
        raise TypeError("Data is None")
# After
def process(data):
    if data is None:
        raise TypeError("Data is None")
    if not data.is_valid():
        raise ValueError("Invalid data")
    if not data.has_permission():
        raise PermissionError("No permission")
    return do_work(data)
```

### React / JSX

```tsx
// SIMPLIFY: Verbose conditional rendering
// Before
function UserBadge({ user }: Props) {
  if (user.isAdmin) {
    return <Badge variant="admin">Admin</Badge>;
  } else {
    return <Badge variant="default">User</Badge>;
  }
}
// After
function UserBadge({ user }: Props) {
  const variant = user.isAdmin ? 'admin' : 'default';
  const label = user.isAdmin ? 'Admin' : 'User';
  return <Badge variant={variant}>{label}</Badge>;
}

// SIMPLIFY: Prop drilling through intermediate components
// Before --- consider whether context or composition solves this better.
// This is a judgment call --- flag it, don't auto-refactor.
```

## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "It's working, no need to touch it" | Working code that's hard to read will be hard to fix when it breaks. Simplifying now saves time on every future change. |
| "Fewer lines is always simpler" | A 1-line nested ternary is not simpler than a 5-line if/else. Simplicity is about comprehension speed, not line count. |
| "I'll just quickly simplify this unrelated code too" | Unscoped simplification creates noisy diffs and risks regressions in code you didn't intend to change. Stay focused. |
| "The types make it self-documenting" | Types document structure, not intent. A well-named function explains *why* better than a type signature explains *what*. |
| "This abstraction might be useful later" | Don't preserve speculative abstractions. If it's not used now, it's complexity without value. Remove it and re-add when needed. |
| "The original author must have had a reason" | Maybe. Check git blame --- apply Chesterton's Fence. But accumulated complexity often has no reason; it's just the residue of iteration under pressure. |
| "I'll refactor while adding this feature" | Separate refactoring from feature work. Mixed changes are harder to review, revert, and understand in history. |

## Red Flags

- Simplification that requires modifying tests to pass (you likely changed behavior)
- "Simplified" code that is longer and harder to follow than the original
- Renaming things to match your preferences rather than project conventions
- Removing error handling because "it makes the code cleaner"
- Simplifying code you don't fully understand
- Batching many simplifications into one large, hard-to-review commit
- Refactoring code outside the scope of the current task without being asked

## Verification

After completing a simplification pass:

- [ ] All existing tests pass without modification
- [ ] Build succeeds with no new warnings
- [ ] Linter/formatter passes (no style regressions)
- [ ] Each simplification is a reviewable, incremental change
- [ ] The diff is clean --- no unrelated changes mixed in
- [ ] Simplified code follows project conventions (checked against CLAUDE.md or equivalent)
- [ ] No error handling was removed or weakened
- [ ] No dead code was left behind (unused imports, unreachable branches)
- [ ] A teammate or review agent would approve the change as a net improvement
